# SE2205B-LabAssignment2

**Objectives of this assignment**

The  queue  data  structure  can  be  used  for  modelling  and  simulating  many  interesting  systems.   In  manypractical systems, some kind of buffers/queues are used to temporarily place tasks or items prior to processingthese. Entities arriving first at the buffer are processed first. Since the FIFO service paradigm is quite naturalin a broad range of practical systems, queues can be naturally used to model the behaviour of these.  In this assignment, we modelled a simple data network.
